Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) is an algorithm which concurrently learns a Q-function and a policy. It uses off-policy data and the Bellman equation to learn the Q-function, and uses the Q-function to learn the policy.

This approach is closely connected to Q-learning, and is motivated the same way: if you know the optimal action-value function Q^*(s,a), then in any given state, the optimal action a^*(s) can be found by solving

a^*(s) = \arg \max_a Q^*(s,a).

DDPG interleaves learning an approximator to Q^*(s,a) with learning an approximator to a^*(s), and it does so in a way which is specifically adapted for environments with continuous action spaces. But what does it mean that DDPG is adapted specifically for environments with continuous action spaces? It relates to how we compute the max over actions in \max_a Q^*(s,a).

When there are a finite number of discrete actions, the max poses no problem, because we can just compute the Q-values for each action separately and directly compare them. (This also immediately gives us the action which maximizes the Q-value.) But when the action space is continuous, we canâ€™t exhaustively evaluate the space, and solving the optimization problem is highly non-trivial. Using a normal optimization algorithm would make calculating \max_a Q^*(s,a) a painfully expensive subroutine. And since it would need to be run every time the agent wants to take an action in the environment, this is unacceptable.
